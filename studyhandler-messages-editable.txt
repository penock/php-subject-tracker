Your login/ID for training and follow-up to meeting
[[ADD-MN-MESSAGE-START]]
Thank you for coming in for the meeting.

During our meeting, you may recall that we entered your login/ID into your handheld while visiting the training website. It will remember your login/ID, so you shouldn't need it again during the study. However, just in case your browser memory (with your bookmark and "cookies") happens to get wiped (e.g. for technical support on your handheld, unrelated to the study, you clear your cookies or reset your phone back to the default factory settings), here is the complete info, which you could use to set up your handheld training again:

The training website: handheldtrainingstudy.com/train
Your login/ID for training: P_ID

We have made online instructions available to you. They cover essentially what we went through in the meeting, but please look through them briefly, to review, at:
http://handheldtrainingstudy.com/instructions-m/?email=P_EMAIL

Also, we're sending you a separate email with the first weekly questions set to complete.

After doing that, just continue your training by doing today's remaining 2 sessions and continuing with the 3x/day schedule we discussed. One of us will check in with you in a few days to see how you're doing.

[[ADD-ON-SUBJECT]]
Ready to begin training now -- please begin as soon as possible
[[ADD-ON-MESSAGE-START]]
Based on random assignment, you will not be receiving delayed active training. Therefore, you'll start right away with training, which will be either active or control training. You'll find out which one you had at the end of the study, after the 2-month follow-up. For a description of the conditions, see http://handheldtrainingstudy.com/intro-p3.php

You are now ready to follow the online instructions and begin training. Please do this as soon as possible, or within 72 hours from now at the latest.

To begin, use a laptop or desktop computer to visit the following site, so it can walk you through beginning training on your handheld, step by step:
http://handheldtrainingstudy.com/instructions-o/?email=P_EMAIL

Viewing past the beginning of those instructions the first time will automatically initiate your training schedule to start at day 1. (It's okay to re-visit later.)

At some point during the instructions, you will need your login/ID for training. 

Your login/ID for training is: P_ID

After you finish the instructions, please send us an email to tell us that you're starting training, so that we can make sure things are going smoothly.
[[ADD-ON-MESSAGE-END]]

/******************************************************************************/

[[ADD-OD-SUBJECT]]
You have been assigned to delayed active training (includes your login)
[[ADD-OD-MESSAGE-START]]
Based on random assignment, you'll be receiving delayed active training. For a comparison of this condition to the others, see http://handheldtrainingstudy.com/intro-p3.php

For the next 4 weeks (the "delay period"), your role is to respond to the questions sets that we send you each week. There won't be any training until the end of these 4 weeks--then, after the 4 weeks are up, you will receive the active training.

In case you would like further details, below is the full description of delayed active training from the consent form that you saw when signing up for the study. Please read that description carefully before emailing us for clarification, which we'll gladly provide if needed.

We're sending you another email right now with the first weekly questions set. Once you respond to it, your 4-week delay period will begin.

Lastly, when your active training begins (4 weeks from now), you will need your own login for training. Please make a note of it (for example, on your handheld device in a calendar entry 4 weeks from now).

Your login will be: P_ID 

---

In the delayed active training condition, there are differences from the other two (active and control) conditions. First, your training will be delayed, meaning that for 4 weeks, you will not do any training. Rather, you will simply respond to online questions that we send you each week. At the end of this period, you will receive active training for 4 weeks. If you are unable to start right after the 4-week delay period, we will allow you to start active training later. We require you to complete questions sets during the 4-week delay period. As long as you have completed these on time, you will have earned your access to the active training.

Another important difference from the other conditions is that, in the delayed active training condition, you will know which condition you are in, and you will be guaranteed to receive the active training after only 4 weeks  in the study. Thus, in the delayed active training condition, the drawbacks are that you must wait to start any training and that you must complete 5 extra questions sets; however, the benefit is that you wait 4 weeks instead of 3 months (as the other conditions require) to receive guaranteed active training.

Now that the delay period is up, you have the opportunity to begin training, which will be active training. For a description of the conditions, see http://handheldtrainingstudy.com/intro-p3.php

Most people prefer to start right away, which you can do. We would also prefer this. If you have a conflict, however, such as going on vacation without internet access for a full week, you should wait until after that to begin. If you do need to wait, don't click the link below, and no need to reply to this email. You can ignore reminders to start from our system for the next few days, then you can begin when you're ready (within reason--contact us if you want to wait more than 3 weeks), and return to this email to start.

To begin training now, use a laptop or desktop computer to visit the following site, so it can walk you through how to begin training on your handheld, step by step:
http://handheldtrainingstudy.com/instructions-o/?email=P_EMAIL

Viewing past the beginning of those instructions the first time will automatically initiate your training schedule to start at day 1. (It's okay to re-visit later.)

At some point during the instructions, you will need your login/ID for training. You should retrieve the one we emailed you at the start of the delay period (presumably 4 weeks ago). At the time, we suggested that you might note it in your handheld device's calendar for approximately today. You can also go and find the email we sent: In your email site/program, run a search for team@handheldtrainingstudy.com (or from that address), and go to the oldest emails to find the one with your login, which had the subject line, "You have been assigned to delayed active training (includes your login)". If you try but can't find it, email us.

After you finish the instructions, please send us an email to tell us that you're starting training, so that we can make sure things are going smoothly.

[[DROPEARLY-SUBJECT]]
Discontinuing your participation in Handheld Training Study
[[DROPEARLY-MESSAGE-START]]
We gather that you have chosen to or have needed to discontinue your participation in the study. This is not a problem, and you have no further obligations for the study.

Please reply if you have any questions.

The following is the debriefing statement about the study that we are required to send you, in case you would like to know more.

-------

Your contribution will help in understanding and improving this method as a treatment for social anxiety and excessive worrying. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email or contact me by phone. I would be happy to meet to discuss any questions you may have.

The following text provides more some detailed information about the training procedure. It is not known whether reading the text below will reduce (or improve) the effectiveness of the training method if you continue to use it.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is defined by an impairing level of anxiety about social situations and about being evaluated unfavorably by others. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is defined by having uncontrollable worry about many things, accompanied by symptoms of tension such as restlessness, irritability and sleep disturbance. The symptoms of these disorders are also experienced by many people who do not qualify for the full diagnosis of a disorder but may benefit from treatment.

Numerous studies show that people with SAD and GAD exhibit selective processing for threat. The greater attentional resources devoted to threatening stimuli foster anxiety pronenesss (McNally & Reese, 2009). Attentional bias is thought to heighten focus on external indicators of negative evaluation by others, thus playing an important role in maintaining the disorder (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). These mechanisms have been found to be fully active in individuals who do not meet an SAD diagnosis but who have high levels of social anxiety.

The computerized treatment used in this study has been termed Attention Modification. It was developed to reduce threat bias and thus curtail social anxiety. In a repeated process, two faces are presented on the screen, one neutral and one threatening, and participants are implicitly steered to look at the neutral face rather than the threatening one.

Results have been promising: in Amir et al. (2008), patients diagnosed with generalized SAD were given 20 minutes of training, twice a week for 4 weeks. Afterward, 50% of patients in the active condition no longer met diagnostic criteria for SAD, compared with 14% of patients in the control condition, which used of the same computer task that does not steer the user. Anxiety symptoms were reduced and remained lowered in a 4-month follow-up. Comparable results were also obtained in a study applied to GAD with a similar protocol (Amir, Beard, Burns, & Bomyea, 2009), and an additional study with SAD patients (Schmidt, Richey, Buckner, & Timpano, 2009).

In all three of the aforementioned studies, regardless of whether they involved SAD or GAD patients, found significant reductions in general anxiety measures in the treatment groups more than control groups. Thus, evidence indicates that the same treatment can address both types of anxiety issues.

This study follows our first study, which was the first two study of Attention Modification in handheld format. Using handhelds allowed us to test a more continuous, potentially more effective and convenient training schedule.

If you have any questions about this research, please contact Phil Enock, .
